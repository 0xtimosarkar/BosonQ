In this verification, we use the QASM-Plus-Spec.k file that defines the syntax and semantics of the QASM language. We add two rules to this specification: one to initialize the ASCII qubits and another to decode the ASCII values and print "hello world". The second rule uses the MapItem syntax to check the values of the measured qubits, and if they correspond to the ASCII code for "hello world", the rule adds the expected output to the kResult.

To verify the QASM code using this specification, we can use the K framework's kprove tool with the -m VERIFICATION flag.
